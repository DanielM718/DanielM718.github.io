                Before composing these texts I began by researching the genre using a tertiary source. Resources like wikipedia and AI are helpful for getting a high level overview of a subject's purpose, structure, and conventions. Strong tertiary sources also cite credible secondary and primary sources, which helped guide my approach to research. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Next I sought secondary sources from people with experience in the industry to see how they write. These sources provide more detailed insight into how a genre is used in practice, outlining the reasoning behind language conventions, structure, and style. This gave me a deeper understanding of a genre but also gave me an idea of what to look for when analyzing primary sources.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly I apply what I've learned through analyzing professional examples from the computer hardware industry to see how engineers communicate in a real workplace environment. Tying the core themes from the text book readings I focused on how structure, tone, and formatting were used.
              </p>
              <p>
                What I learned from the primary, secondary, and tertiary sources gave me a model to apply to my own writing. Across each of my genres there was a consistent pattern of highly structured layouts, short paragraphs or bullet points, and a clear separation of ideas. Seeing these patterns reinforced a lot of the messages echoed by the textbook, that workplace writing is less about aesthetics, and more about clarity, consistency, and usability for the reader. 
              </p>
              <p>
                AI was most useful during the revision stage of the correspondence project rather than the initial drafting. I used it to reword sentences for clarity, proofread for grammatical errors, and identify awkward phrasing. In many cases, it required me to revise the output to better fit the project. I employed some of the prompting strategies discussed in class and it improved the output requiring fewer revisions. This need for review emphases the importance of human judgment when using AI as a supportive tool.
              </p>
              <p>
                I used GitHub Pages as the platform for this project because it gave me full control over the structure and presentation of the website. While it's not the most beginner-friendly option, I am experienced and it proved quicker than learning to use a website builder and building it manually. I gave ChatGPT a color scheme, visual features I wanted, and a structure to use and it generated a completely ready to use website. I filled in the website with the information required for this project and it was ready to deploy. This method for me made website building the quickest and easiest part of this project. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Through this project, I learned how rhetoric, genre conventions, and workplace expectations shape professional writing. These skills,including audience awareness, clear structure, and maintaining a clear purpose, are directly applicable to my current coursework and future professional work in engineering, where clear communication is essential for decision making, collaboration, and documentation.

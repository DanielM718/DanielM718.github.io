                Before composing these texts I began by researching the genre using a tertiary source. 
                Resources like wikipedia and AI are helpful for getting a high level overview of a subject's purpose, 
                structure, and conventions. Strong tertiary sources also cite credible secondary and primary sources, 
                which helped guide my approach to research. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Next I sought secondary sources from people with experience in the industry to see how they write. 
                These sources provide more detailed insight into how a genre is used in practice, outlining the reasoning 
                behind language conventions, structure, and style. This gave me a deeper understanding of a genre but also 
                gave me an idea of what to look for when analyzing primary sources.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly I apply what I've learned through analyzing professional examples from the computer hardware industry 
                to see how engineers communicate in a real workplace environment. Tying the core themes from the text book readings 
                I focused on how structure, tone, and formatting were used.
              </p>
              <p>
                What I learned from the primary, secondary, and tertiary sources gave me a model to apply to my own writing. Across 
                each of my genres there was a consistent pattern of highly structured layouts, short paragraphs or bullet points, 
                and a clear separation of ideas. Seeing these patterns reinforced a lot of the messages echoed by the textbook, 
                that workplace writing is less about aesthetics, and more about clarity, consistency, and usability for the reader. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Good workplace writing uses plain english, is direct and to the point, accounts for who is reading, and leaves little 
                room for ambiguity. The distinction between genres emerge as a result of the specific workplace needs. Writing 
                with these in mind allowed me to produce text that paralleled professional workplace writing more closely.
